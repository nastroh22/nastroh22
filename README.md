- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a thesis on control theory and decentralized finance applications
-  âš¡ I just asked chatgpt for a fun fact and it's not half bad:
  
Did you know that octopuses have three hearts? Two of the hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Whatâ€™s even more fascinating is that when an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer crawling instead of swimmingâ€”swimming exhausts them quickly!
